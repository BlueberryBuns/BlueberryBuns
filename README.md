### Howdy folks ðŸ‘‹

I'm data/software engineer currently pursuing masters degree at the Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. I fancy code optimisation and high performance processing modules. My main domains are Python and AWS (terraform as IaC), apart from that I enjoy writing Go code.

As a resolution I would love to polish my Spark and Rust skills in 2023.

Here are some of the project I've made over last couple of years.
